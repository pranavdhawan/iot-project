# iot-project - Open Innovation

IOT project to read IR-Sensor data from an Arduino Board and publish it to a firebase backend

### How it works
The arduino board is set up with an HW-201 IR Sensor which gets obstacle readings from its environment. The python code uses the *serial* python library which gets data from the serial port and parses it in a readable format to the Firebase Realtime Data Backend.
